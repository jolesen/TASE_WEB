* Objectives and scope

    Now on its 11th edition, TASE is an international symposium that aims to bring 
  together researchers and developers from academia and industry with interests 
  in the theoretical aspects of software engineering. We invite submissions of 
  research papers on topics covering all theoretical aspects of software 
  engineering, including, but not limited to, the following:

* Submission guidelines

    We solicit contributions that describe original and unpublished research, 
  and should not be submitted for publication elsewhere. They are limited to 
  8 pages, must be written in English, and the format should adhere to the 
  A4 double column IEEE style. Please prepare your manuscripts with respect 
  to the IEEE guidelines. Papers should be submitted electronically as a PDF 
  file via the Easychair system at 

   

            http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tase2017.

 

  The proceedings of the TASE 2017 symposium will include all accepted papers 
  in the proceedings (waiting for Technical co-Sponship by IEEE).
  
  As usual, we are now contacting the journal of Science of Computer Programming, 
  and hopefully selected papers will be invited after the symposium to submit an 
  extended version to a journal special issue Science of Computer Programming.
